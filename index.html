        <h2>Feeding and Nutrition</h2>
        <p>Choosing the right dog food is one of the most important things you can do to maintain your dog’s health. Make sure to consult with your vet to choose food that matches your dog’s age, size, and activity level.</p>
        <p>Regular feeding schedules help your dog maintain a healthy digestive system. Puppies typically need more frequent meals, while adult dogs usually eat twice a day.</p>
        <p>Remember to always have fresh water available for your dog to stay hydrated throughout the day!</p>

        <h2>Health and Hygiene</h2>
        <p>Regular grooming helps to keep your dog’s coat healthy. Depending on the breed, you may need to brush your dog’s fur every few days or weekly. Dogs with long coats typically require more frequent grooming than short-haired dogs.</p>
        <p>Bathing should be done when necessary. Over-bathing can strip natural oils from your dog’s skin, so try to bathe them once a month unless they get particularly dirty.</p>
        <p>It’s also essential to stay on top of vaccinations and flea/tick prevention. Regular vet check-ups ensure your dog stays healthy and that they receive the necessary vaccines and medications.</p>
